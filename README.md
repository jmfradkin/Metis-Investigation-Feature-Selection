# Metis-Investigation-Feature-Selection

Here is an iPython notebook showing examples of various methods (mainly in the Scikit-Learn toolkit) applied to a sample classification data set that can be used as feature selection methods:

1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  
2. Feature importances using tree-based methods
3. Variance Threshold
4. SelectKBest
5. SelectFromModel
6. Recursive Feature Elimination
7. Pearson Correlation
8. Maximal Information Coefficient
9. Model Based Ranking (Univariate Feature Selection)
